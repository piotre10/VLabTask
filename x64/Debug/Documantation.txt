lo [left-outer]- left outer join
ro [right-outer]- right outer join

Common errors:

File error - error occured while opening/operating on file check file path

Index error - if occured joining csv-s probably means that specified column does not exist in one of files, check if colname is same in both files

Incompatible sizes - if occured during file reading probably means that one or both of csv-s has non rectangular "table" (some fields or more precisely commas are missing)
